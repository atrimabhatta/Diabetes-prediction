# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction Project**!
This project uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.

---

## 📌 Overview

Diabetes is among the top chronic diseases worldwide, affecting millions of people each year.
Early detection is crucial, as it helps in taking precautionary measures to avoid severe complications.

This project leverages **data-driven insights** to:
✅ Predict the likelihood of diabetes
✅ Empower individuals with risk assessments
✅ Support proactive healthcare decisions

---

## 📊 Dataset

We have used the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following features:

* Number of pregnancies
* Glucose concentration
* Blood pressure
* Skin thickness
* Insulin levels
* BMI (Body Mass Index)
* Diabetes pedigree function
* Age
* Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

📂 File: `diabetes.csv`

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python** 🐍
* **Flask** (for web deployment)
* **HTML, CSS** (for front-end templates)
* **Pandas, NumPy** (for data preprocessing)
* **Scikit-learn** (for ML model building)
